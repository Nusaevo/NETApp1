## Livewire 3 Concepts

### Models

In Livewire 3, models are typically used to represent the data you are working with. You can bind your Livewire components directly to Eloquent models, which allows for seamless data manipulation and retrieval. When you update the model in the component, it automatically reflects in the database.

### Livewire Components

Livewire components are the building blocks of your application. Each component can contain its own logic, rendering, and lifecycle hooks. You can create components for different parts of your application, allowing you to organize your code better. Components are written in PHP and can be rendered in Blade views.

### Resource Blade Views

Resource Blade views are used to display and manage your resources (like models). They are integrated with Livewire components to provide a reactive user interface. You can define views for creating, updating, and displaying your models, making it easier to manage CRUD operations without writing much JavaScript.
